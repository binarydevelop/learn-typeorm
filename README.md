 ## Typescript
 ![Typescript](/ts.jpg)
 **Typescript**  is a *superset* of Javascript. A language building up on Javascript.
### About Typescript:
 - Adds new Features & advantages to Javascript.
 - Browser can't execute it.
 - Typescript is a powerful compiler which is used to compile your `ts` code to `js` code.
 - Features are compiled to Js workarounds.
 - It also adds `type` which results in less error prone code.

 #### Install Typescript
 ``` typescript
 npm i -g typescript
 ```

 - ### How to run ts code?
 > Example: add.ts
 ``` typescript
    function add(num1: number, num2: number): number {
        return num1 + num2;
    }

    console.log(add(2,3));
 ```
 This will create a **js** compiled file called `add.js`, which can be executed using `node add.js`
